# AI Skills Gap Analyzer  
An early prototype that **analyzes a resume against a chosen job role** and highlights:  
- **Match percentage score**  
- **Missing required & nice-to-have skills**  
- **Recommended courses/resources**  

---

## 🌟 Why This Matters  
Today’s job market changes quickly, and students often don’t know what skills they’re missing for a target career. This tool shows how AI can **bridge the gap between education and industry needs** by automatically:  
1. Extracting skills from a resume  
2. Comparing them to curated job role templates  
3. Prioritizing what to learn next

## 🛠️ Current Prototype  
- Paste **resume text** → Select **target job role** → Click **Analyze**  
- Get:  
  - A **percentage fit score**  
  - A list of **missing skills**  
  - A **learning plan with resources**  

🔎 Example:  
> *Resume vs. Data Analyst* → **68% fit** → Missing *SQL, Tableau, Statistics* → Suggested resources linked.

## 🚀 Future Potential  
This prototype lays the foundation for a much richer system:  
- **Smarter Skill Extraction** → Using embeddings + NLP instead of keyword matching  
- **Dynamic Job Data** → Pulling live job postings instead of static CSVs  
- **Personalized Learning** → Tailored resource recommendations based on user profile  
- **Dashboard View** → Track progress and skill acquisition over time
